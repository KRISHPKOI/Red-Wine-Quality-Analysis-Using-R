#### About the Project
In this project I used R to do Analysis of **Red Wine Data** which contains 1,599 red wines with 11 variables on the chemical properties of the wine. My focus is to see how each chemical component influences the quality of wine (0 'very bad' to 10 'very excellent'). I made a model to predict the quality of Red Wine. This dataset is public available for research. The details are described in [Cortez et al., 2009].
